# Manufacturing_Defects_Analysis
Scenario: A manufacturing company want to decrease the number of defects they are producing after the final assembly process. This analysis uses Pareto Charts, One-Way ANOVA hypothesis testing, and a Tableau dashboard to identify the defect types that have the largest impact.
I also created a presentation to explain the analysis and provide recommendations to solve the organization problem.
